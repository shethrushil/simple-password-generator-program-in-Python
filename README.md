# simple-password-generator-program-in-Python


here's an example source code for a simple password generator program in Python:

In this program, the generate_password() function takes an integer length as input and generates a random password of the specified length. The set of characters to choose from includes all ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation symbols.

The program prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password, then calls the generate_password() function to generate a password of the specified length. Finally, the program prints the generated password.

This is just one example implementation, you can modify and customize it to fit your needs and preferences.
